## Description

> **One logic unit to rule them all.**

Encapsulate your business logic in atomic, self-contained classes and reuse them across your entire application stack. Write once, use everywhere.

This package extends [Laravel Actions](https://laravelactions.com) with support for:
- **Laravel Nova Actions** - Use actions directly as Nova actions
- **Laravel MCP Tools** - Use actions as Model Context Protocol tools for AI

The same logic can serve multiple audiences:
- **For end users** → Nova Actions in your admin panel
- **For administrators** → Artisan commands in the terminal
- **For external systems** → API endpoints via controllers
- **For AI agents** → MCP tools for intelligent automation

## Usage

### Real-World Example: ResetPassword

Here's a complete example showing how a single `ResetPassword` action can serve your entire application:

```php
use Opscale\Actions\Action;

class ResetPassword extends Action
{
    public function identifier(): string
    {
        return 'reset-password';
    }

    public function name(): string
    {
        return 'Reset Password';
    }

    public function description(): string
    {
        return 'Resets a user\'s password';
    }

    public function parameters(): array
    {
        return [
            [
                'name' => 'email',
                'description' => 'The email address of the user',
                'type' => 'string',
                'rules' => ['required', 'email', 'exists:users,email'],
            ],
            [
                'name' => 'password',
                'description' => 'The new password',
                'type' => 'string',
                'rules' => ['required', 'string', 'min:8'],
            ],
            [
                'name' => 'password_confirmation',
                'description' => 'Confirm the new password',
                'type' => 'string',
                'rules' => ['required', 'string', 'same:password'],
            ],
        ];
    }

    public function handle(array $attributes = []): array
    {
        $this->fill($attributes);
        $validated = $this->validateAttributes();

        $user = User::where('email', $validated['email'])->firstOrFail();
        $user->update(['password' => Hash::make($validated['password'])]);

        return [
            'success' => true, 
            'message' => 'Password reset successfully'
        ];
    }
}
```

### One Action, Multiple Contexts

Now this single class can be used everywhere:

```php
// For end users → Nova Action in admin panel
// Register in your Nova Resource:
public function actions(NovaRequest $request)
{
    return [
        ResetPassword::make()
    ];
}

// For administrators → Artisan command
// php artisan reset-password --email=user@example.com --password=newpass123
$this->commands([
    ResetPassword::class,
]);

// For external systems → API endpoint
Route::post('/api/reset-password', ResetPassword::class);

// For AI agents → MCP tool
// Register in your MCP Server:
class PlatformServer extends Server
{
    protected array $tools = [
        ResetPassword::class
    ];
}
```

### Opinionated Design

This package is an opinionated implementation that enforces the use of `WithAttributes` from [Laravel Actions](https://laravelactions.com). All input data flows through `fill()` and `validateAttributes()`, ensuring consistent parameters validation and attribute handling across all contexts.

The package provides a default behavior for all four audiences (Nova Actions, Artisan Commands, Controllers, and MCP Tools), so your actions work out of the box without additional configuration, but it can be overriden using the speficic methods for each output.
